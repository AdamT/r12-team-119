# free time

App to find times when everybody is free for something.

## Build

    rake db:migrate
    rails s

In development mode, we are catching all of the mail with `letter_opener`, which
means any emails are available in tmp/letter_opener. The directory is mounted as
/mail in development mode, `rake mail:clear` to empty

Considerations
==============

* You can change a persons responses by knowing their email - we should require confirmation
  before saving changes to a specific user.
